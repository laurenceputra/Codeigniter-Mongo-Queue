# Codeigniter-Mongo-Queue

Codeigniter Mongo Queue is a plug and play addon to the Codeigniter framework

To use it, ensure that you have changed the settings in `application/models/core_model.php` to connect to the db of your choice.

You can add a job by calling `enqueue` in `models/queue_model.php`

Queue is called by running the `queue` function in `controllers/queue.php` from the command line.
