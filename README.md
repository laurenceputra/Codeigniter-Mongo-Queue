# Codeigniter-Mongo-Queue

Codeigniter Mongo Queue is a plug and play addon to the Codeigniter framework

To use it, ensure that you have changed the settings in application/models/core_model.php to connect to the db of your choice.

You can add a job by calling enqueue in models/queue_model.php

Queue is called by running the queue function in controllers/queue.php from the command line.
